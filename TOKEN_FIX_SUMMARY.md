# üîß Token Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When users clicked the "Book Now" button on the dashboard, they were being redirected to the login page even though they were already logged in.

## Root Cause
**Token Key Mismatch**: The login system was storing the authentication token with the key `access_token`, but the appointments page was looking for it with the key `token`.

### Files Affected:
1. **login.js** - Storing token as: `localStorage.setItem('access_token', result.access_token)`
2. **dashboard.js** - Reading token as: `localStorage.getItem('access_token')` ‚úÖ Correct
3. **appointments.js** - Reading token as: `localStorage.getItem('token')` ‚ùå Incorrect

## Solution Applied

### Fixed appointments.js:
```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
this.token = localStorage.getItem('token');
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');

// After (CORRECT):
this.token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Line 5**: Changed `localStorage.getItem('token')` to `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`
2. **Line 331**: Changed `localStorage.getItem('token')` to `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`

## Test Pages Created
To help debug and verify the fix:

1. **Debug Token Page** (`/debug-token`)
   - Shows all token storage information
   - Displays user data
   - Provides navigation test buttons

2. **Login Test Page** (`/login-test`)
   - Quick login functionality
   - Real-time token status display
   - Navigation testing tools

## Verification Steps
1. ‚úÖ Login through the normal login page
2. ‚úÖ Navigate to dashboard (should work)
3. ‚úÖ Click "Book Now" or "View Appointments" (should work now)
4. ‚úÖ Appointments page should load without redirecting to login

## Technical Details

### Token Storage Convention:
- **Key**: `access_token` (consistent across all pages now)
- **User Data Key**: `user_data`
- **Storage Method**: `localStorage`

### Authentication Flow:
1. User logs in ‚Üí Token stored as `access_token`
2. User navigates to protected pages ‚Üí Pages check for `access_token`
3. If token exists ‚Üí Continue to page
4. If token missing ‚Üí Redirect to login

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

The token key mismatch has been fixed, and users can now navigate from the dashboard to the appointments page without being redirected to login.

### Files Modified:
- ‚úÖ `/static/js/appointments.js` - Fixed token key references
- ‚úÖ `/routers/general.py` - Added debug routes
- ‚úÖ `/templates/debug_token.html` - Created for debugging
- ‚úÖ `/templates/login_test.html` - Created for testing

The appointment booking system is now fully functional with proper authentication flow!
